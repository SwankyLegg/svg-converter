# SVG Converter

A web application for converting and resizing SVG files. Built with Next.js and deployed on GitHub Pages. Use it to convert your SVG brand assets into PNG and JPG formats at multiple sizes. Upload your SVG files, select your desired output formats and sizes, and download organized ZIP files containing all your converted assets. Assets are resized by mimicking to fill the container without distoring the original dimensions, doing the equivalent of CSS's <code>object-fit: contain;</code> on the SVG.
